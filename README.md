# Augmented Audio Encounter
Augmented Audio Encounter (AAE) is a platform for the creation and consumption of a new kind of media: nonlinear, interactive multiplayer augmented audio adventures.

Audio adventures:: it's a game or a narration based on audio

Augemented: the audio track is an overlay on top of your physical reality, adding a narrative, artistic layer

Multiplayer: the experience can be shared by a group of people, the audio tracks will be played back synchronized across their devices

Interactive: AAE games allow the user of interacitve elements as e.g. multiple choice options

Nonlinear: AAE narration can branch depending on the choices of the players - similar to a "Choose Your Own Adventure" book

The two main part of this project are:

- AAE-Author: an authoring webapp for creating AAE content
- AAE-Player: a simple and slim mobile optimized webapp to play AAE content
